# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React Effect skills by fetching and posting data from/to an API. There had to be a like button and a time display, and a constant update of the feed.


### The Problem

I started of by creating a Flow-chart, to understand which components I'd like to create that made sense to me. I decided to create a main one, then one focusing on the previous messages, one on the new message you can create and one focusing on adding likes. I used useEffect in the mainComponent. I made a function for the time format but later changed it for the date-fns module. I struggled a bit with the update of likes, it wasnt sync, so I ended up having to press twice. But worked it out with async. If I had more time I'd go for the stretch goals.
